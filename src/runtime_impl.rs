    /// Adapter for an existing Tokio executor, available with `tokio-runtime`
    /// on non-wasm32 targets. Does not create or keep an executor alive.
    ///
    /// Works with current-thread and multi-thread executors. `spawn` and
    /// `spawn_detached` use the current executor when called; `sleep` requires
    /// its timer driver to be enabled when the sleep future is constructed.
    /// `spawn_blocking` uses the current executor when its future is first polled.
    ///
    /// - `spawn` returns an [`AbortHandle`] that requests cancellation on drop.
    ///   Cancellation does not wait for destruction or preempt a running poll.
    /// - `spawn_detached` and [`AbortHandle::detach`] let a task outlive its
    ///   handle's scope, but do not guarantee completion across executor shutdown.
    /// - `spawn_blocking` submits nothing until polled. Once submitted, dropping
    ///   its future leaves queued or running work alive. Blocking work runs on
    ///   separate threads even with a current-thread executor; started work can
    ///   delay executor shutdown until it finishes.
    /// - `yield_now` is a no-op returning `None`, with inherited frequency 10,
    ///   on both executor flavors. It provides no scheduling point or fairness
    ///   guarantee. Tight loops must arrange their own cooperative yielding;
    ///   multiple workers do not eliminate that need.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// Missing Tokio context panics at the call or first poll described above.
    /// Constructing a sleep also panics if the timer driver is disabled.
    /// With unwinding and Tokio's default panic policy, async task panics are
    /// caught by Tokio and not returned by this adapter. `spawn_blocking` also
    /// discards its join error, so a closure panic resolves as `()`; the panic
    /// hook still runs. Use [`wacore::runtime::blocking`] to return a closure's
    /// result; it raises a new panic if the closure fails to deliver that result.
    /// With `panic = "abort"`, a panic terminates the process instead.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// No `Client` is needed. Disable defaults to omit the bundled storage,
    /// transport and HTTP adapters; this still compiles the main crate and core.
