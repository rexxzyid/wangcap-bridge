//! The relay media transport, and the paths that name it.

//! The native relay stack -- a UDP endpoint per call with DTLS, SCTP and the pre-negotiated
//! DataChannel over it -- is the `native` submodule, gated on `voip-relay-native`. Why that half
//! is a feature of its own is in [`crate::voip`], and stays there.
//!
//! What is decided *here* is that the module around it is not gated: `RandTxIds` and the packet
//! demux have always been reachable at `wangcap_bridge::voip::transport::*`, neither needs a
//! socket, and gating the module for their sake would break every codec-only consumer that imports
//! one -- a build with `voip-mlow` and no relay is exactly the build a browser makes.
