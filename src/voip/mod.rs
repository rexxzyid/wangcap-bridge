//! VoIP calls media plane: the call state machine, the media pipeline, encoded audio, and the
//! relay transport that carries them. Pure protocol/crypto lives in `wacore::voip`.
//!
//! # Two halves, and only one of them owns a socket
//!
//! Everything here except [`transport`] is portable: it drives `wacore`'s sans-IO engine over an
//! injected [`Runtime`](wacore::runtime::Runtime) and an injected
//! [`wacore::voip::transport::RelayTransportFactory`], so it names no clock
//! and opens no descriptor. That half is `voip-runtime`, and it builds wherever `wacore` does.
//!
//! [`transport`] is the other half -- a UDP socket per call with DTLS, SCTP and the pre-negotiated
//! DataChannel over it -- and it is `voip-relay-native`, because a UDP socket is exactly what
//! wasm32 and espidf do not have. A page reaches the same relay through an `RTCPeerConnection`,
//! which is a factory it supplies with [`Client::set_relay_transport_provider`]; it needs no part of
//! this module's native half, and asking for one used to be a `compile_error!` across the whole
//! feature rather than across the socket.
//!
//! [`Client::set_relay_transport_provider`]: crate::client::Client::set_relay_transport_provider

// Fail fast with an actionable message instead of a confusing link error further down. Narrowed to
// the transport: `voip-runtime` alone is portable, and the message now names the way forward
// rather than only the wall.
