//! Feeding the VoIP engine a real signaling stanza.
//!
//! The stanza is built with wangcap-bridge's own binary codec and handed to
//! WhatsApp Web's engine. The engine's internal log is what makes this a test
//! rather than a smoke check: it names the argument it read, the parser error it
//! hit, and the subsystem that failed, so the assertions are about behaviour
//! instead of about "the call returned void".
//!
//! Argument order and encoding both come from WhatsApp Web's own bridge:
//!
//! ```js
//! handleIncomingSignalingOffer(serializeVoipWapNode(node), ...)
//! // serializeVoipWapNode = base64(encodeStanza(node) minus its flag byte)
//! ```
//!
//! All identities are fictitious.
//!
//! # Why these are `#[ignore]`d
//!
//! Because they are slow. Each brings up PJSIP's worker pool under host-driven
//! scheduling, and the file takes about fifteen minutes:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --release --test signaling -- --ignored --test-threads 1
//! ```
//!
//! `--test-threads 1` matters: several engines at once still contend for cores.
//!
//! # What it took to make them reliable
//!
//! Four separate problems, each measured rather than guessed:
//!
//! - **Startup raced about one time in nine.** `initVoipStack` finishes in
//!   ~5 ms, and the trap landed with 99.6% of the fuel untouched and the media
//!   init already logged as complete — a race between the calling thread and
//!   `call_event_proc` starting. `schedule.rs` now lets only one guest thread
//!   execute at a time, which took the rate to roughly 1 in 40; six retries in
//!   `engine()` cover the remainder.
//! - **Offer handling is asynchronous.** The call returning says nothing about
//!   whether the event thread has done the work, so `wait_for_reaction` waits
//!   for the log to grow and then go quiet instead of sleeping a fixed amount.
//! - **Startup is not one burst of logging**, so "the log went quiet" is not
//!   "startup finished". Under load the gap between the media stack finishing
//!   and `call_event_proc` starting exceeds `QUIET`, and an offer delivered
//!   into it is handled by an engine that has not finished starting.
//!   `engine_with` waits for `call_event_proc resumed` — the last line startup
//!   writes — and treats not reaching it as a failed startup.
//! - **The engine's lock watchdog fires on the offer path**, about one run in
//!   four, and it is ours: `schedule.rs` lets a worker hold a lock across its
//!   whole turn, so the main thread meets the engine's locks in an order its
//!   design does not admit. The run is identical to a good one and then stops
//!   one line short of `wa_call_handle_incoming_xmpp_offer() status 0`. See
//!   `deliver_without_a_lock_inversion`, which retries on exactly that
//!   complaint and on nothing else.
//!
//! The last two are why this file used to say "not because they are unreliable
//! — because they are slow", while `a_well_formed_offer_is_accepted` failed
//! about one run in four. It was both.
//!
//! `examples/init_stress.rs` measures the startup race if the rate needs
//! rechecking after a capture update.
