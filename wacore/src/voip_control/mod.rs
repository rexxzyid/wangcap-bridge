//! The neutral control-plane media seam.
//!
//! This is the boundary the call control plane uses to reach a media engine. Its API names no type
//! from the `crate::voip` module -- only primitives, `String`, `Vec<u8>`, `Bytes`, the out-of-voip
//! `wacore` types (`wacore_binary::Jid`, `crate::types::call::VideoState`,
//! `crate::types::group_call::{GroupCallUpdate, WaitingRoom, ScreenShare}`) and the flat enums and
//! structs defined here. That is what lets a build enable this module and not `voip`: the compiler
//! names the leak if a draft reaches for an engine type.
//!
//! The engine-facing half is intentionally not here. `wangcap-bridge`'s resident backend implements
//! [`VoipMediaBackend`] on top of `wacore::voip::CallEngine` and builds the engine from the neutral
//! spec across this boundary. Events need no translation: the public event type is the engine's own
//! event type under its seam name. `agent_docs/subsystem_boundary.md` records the byte cut (a
//! facade that compiles with `voip` off) and what it took to get there.
