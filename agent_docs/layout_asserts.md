# Layout asserts and how to rebaseline them

Several tests pin `size_of` values so a careless field addition shows up as a
test failure instead of silent memory growth. Those pins break for innocent
reasons too. A dependency upgrade reshapes an embedded struct, a compiler
release repacks padding, and the assert fires with no real regression behind
it. This file lists every pin, says which ones are exact and which are bounds,
and gives the steps to reset one honestly.

## Policy

Exact equality stays only where the value is a contract. A packed struct whose
bytes hit disk, an enum whose width multiplies per string, a queue that must
hold exactly two handles. Everywhere else the assert is a budget, and budgets
use `<=`. A smaller struct is never a failure.

Pointer width gets a `cfg` gate, never a fudge factor. Where the property can
be stated without numbers at all, prefer that. `2 * size_of::<usize>()`,
`size_of::<Agent>() + N`, or `4 * size_of::<usize>()` survive a width change
and a repack that a bare number does not. #1478 and #1479 set this pattern.

## Inventory

Exact, kept exact:

- `DeviceInfo == 8` in `wacore/src/store/traits.rs`. The fields are `u16 +
  u8 + u32`, seven bytes, so the 8-byte size includes one padding byte.
  Growth means the packing broke.
- `QueuedChatMessage == 2 * size_of::<usize>()` in
  `src/handlers/message.rs`. Compositional, already width independent. The
  queue entry must stay two handles.
- `UnifiedSessionManager` equals its fields' sizes in
  `src/unified_session.rs`. Compositional: every field inline, so `new()`
  performs zero heap allocations.
- `Result<Connection, ConnectError> == Result<(), ConnectError>` in
  `src/client/lifecycle.rs`. Compositional: handing back the connection
  costs the caller nothing.
- `Slot<String, u32> > PlainSlot<String, u32>` in `src/portable_cache.rs`.
  Relational: the managed slot must cost more than the plain one.
- `size_of::<Client>()` against a measured base in `src/client/tests.rs`.
  Compositional: the base stacks the fixed part plus each size-varying
  attachment, including feature-gated ones, so only an unaccounted layout
  move trips it.
- The four-word saving in `wacore/libsignal/src/protocol/sender_keys.rs`.
  Stated as `Vec + MessageField == 4 * size_of::<usize>()`, width
  independent. This is the pin that matters there.

Relative bounds:

- Compact mutation-MAC entries in `wacore/src/store/in_memory.rs` must save
  at least one `usize` over the former growable-container entry.
  `mutation_mac_entry_layout_is_smaller_without_capacity_words` compares
  the actual entry types without assuming private struct or tuple layouts.

Budgets, asserted with `<=`:

- `Slot<DispatchKey, DispatchClaim>` under the spelled-out-identity slot in
  `src/portable_cache.rs`, 64-bit only. Relational: the comparison type
  carries the budget, so repacks do not matter, but the gate itself is
  pointer-width specific.

- `StringHint <= 5`, `ParsedJidMeta <= 5` in `wacore/binary/src/encoder.rs`.
  The hint tape stores one entry per string in the payload, so each byte
  multiplies across every string. Only growth fails.
- `SenderKeyState <= 224` (64-bit) and `<= 204` (32-bit),
  `SenderKeyStateStructure <= 48` and `<= 28`, same file. The total floats
  with the protobuf runtime layout, so only the direction is pinned.
- `Slot<u32, Arc<str>> <= 56`, `Slot<SenderMessageId, ()> <= 128` in
  `src/portable_cache.rs`, 64-bit only. The win is the flattened layout
  reusing tail padding. Smaller stays fine.
- `UreqHttpClient <= Agent + 24` in `http_clients/ureq-client/src/lib.rs`,
  64-bit only. The `Agent` half moves with each ureq release, so the assert
  floats with it. The companion `< Agent + Option<HttpResourceReport>` is
  the actual contract.
- `DeviceListRecord <= 64` in `wacore/src/store/traits.rs`. One record lives
  per known contact, so this is a per-contact budget.
- `RuntimeCacheConfig <= 136` in `src/cache_config.rs`, with the companion
  ratio check against `CacheConfig`.
- `UsyncProtocolResult <= 96` in `wacore/src/iq/usync/query.rs`, send
  futures `<= 192` in `src/send/mod.rs`, dispatch claim `<= 56` in
  `src/message/tests.rs`, group snapshot `<= 92` per participant in
  `wacore/src/client/context.rs`, sender-key map `<= 36` per device in
  `src/sender_key_device_cache.rs`, group memo `<= 37` per resolved device
  in `src/client/device_registry.rs`, post-login task future `<= 2048` in
  `src/client/node_io.rs`, server-sync task future `<= 512` in
  `src/handlers/notification/groups.rs`. Pure budgets, already bounds.
- `PlainSlot<String, u32> <= 40` in `src/portable_cache.rs`. The contract is
  key plus hash plus value with no metadata tail; smaller still satisfies it.
- `SkippedKey <= 40` in `wacore/libsignal/src/protocol/state/session.rs`.
  A seed-only skipped key is a `u32` and 32 bytes of seed.
- `Event <= 272` in `wacore/src/types/events.rs`. The ceiling is set by
  `ConnectFailure`; a new variant should box its payload rather than raise
  it.

## Rebaseline procedure

1. Run just the failing test and read the actual size from the failure
   output. Confirm nothing else in that test failed.
2. Find what moved. `git log` on the struct, `cargo tree` for the dependency
   that owns an embedded field, `rustc --version` for a toolchain repack.
   The failure comment names the usual suspect for that assert.
3. Check the compositional assert first. If the width independent property
   still holds, the design did not regress. Only the number drifted.
4. Audit the delta field by field. A new field with a reason is fine.
   Unexplained growth, or growth from a dependency you did not intend to
   take, is a real finding. Fix that instead.
5. Update the bound and the comment next to it. Say what moved and why the
   new number is right. Never bump a number just to turn CI green.
6. Run the layout tests listed below. When the rebaseline is caused only
   by a compiler or dependency move, keep the diff to tests plus this
   file: no production code changes. When an intentional production change
   moved the layout, its bound update belongs in the same change, next to
   the field-level rationale the steps above produced.

Layout tests to run, one filter per command so a failure names its assert:

The client-size pin is feature sensitive: run all three variants above. The
long one is the CI feature set, spelled out so the procedure does not
depend on remembering it; regenerate it with
`cargo xt ci test-features wangcap-bridge` when `Cargo.toml` gains or
loses a feature, since the set follows the manifest.

The sender-key budgets are the only ones with 32-bit branches. The
`--target i686-unknown-linux-gnu` command above exercises them. It needs
`rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu` once, plus a 32-bit-capable C
toolchain for the link: on Debian/Ubuntu that is `sudo apt-get install
gcc-multilib`. Without those the 32-bit run fails before any test
executes. The `Slot` and `Agent` overhead asserts are 64-bit only by
`cfg` gate.
