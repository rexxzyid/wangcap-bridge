//! Reads alongside a write burst, with a reader pool configured.
//! `get_group_metadata` routes through `read_query` (reader connection);
//! `get_devices` and `get_msg_secret_with_ts` are on the `ON_THE_WRITE_QUEUE`
//! allowlist and take the write permit instead. Each contended sample is one
//! burst, holding the permit before the read is issued, and one read, both
//! awaited, so the work per sample is fixed; see `read_under_write` for why a
//! background writer is not measurable here and how the two are ordered.
//!
//! The runtime is built and fully populated in `harness`, before anything is
//! measured, so the one iteration CodSpeed times cannot contain a thread the
//! store happened to need; see [`BLOCKING_THREADS`].
