//! Client-level receive: one inbound message from the decoded stanza to the
//! dispatched event.
//!
//! `wacore`'s `send_receive_benchmark` covers the pure decrypt, and both DM and
//! group receives there are within a few microseconds of their crypto floor.
//! Everything *around* the decrypt — classification, the signal cache
//! checkout, the chat-lane and dedup bookkeeping, plaintext handling, the
//! event bus, the delivery receipt — lives in the `wangcap-bridge` crate, and
//! this target is what puts a number on it.
//!
//! The direct receive and `_burst` cases enter at `handle_incoming_message`
//! and exclude the queue hop. The `worker_*` cases include enqueue and the
//! production chat-lane worker; `worker_lanes` also includes lane shutdown.
//!
//! These fixtures exclude:
//! - **The SQLite backend.** The fixture stores through `InMemoryBackend`.
//! - **First contact.** Session and sender key are established in setup.
//! - **The socket write.** The delivery receipt is marshalled, noise-encrypted
//!   and framed; the transport drops the frame.
