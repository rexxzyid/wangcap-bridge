//! The `Cache<Jid, _>` lookup every inbound message performs.
//!
//! `chat_lanes` (`src/client.rs`) is the hottest structure this repository
//! keys by `Jid`: `handlers::message` resolves one lane per incoming message
//! before anything else happens, so its cost is paid per message rather than
//! per send. The lane itself cannot be driven from a bench target -- `ChatLane`
//! and the field holding it are crate-private, and reaching them needs a
//! connected `Client` -- so what is measured here is the cache it lives in,
//! built the same way (`max_capacity` + `evict_guard`) and keyed the same way,
//! with a value cheap enough that what is left on the clock is the `Jid` hash,
//! the `Jid` equality on a hit, and the cache's own bookkeeping.
//!
//! Driven on a bare poll loop rather than a Tokio runtime: the cache's locks
//! are `async_lock` primitives that resolve without yielding when uncontended,
//! so every future here completes on its first poll, and a runtime in the loop
//! would put its own scheduling on the clock instead of the lookup's.
//!
//! Fixtures are built once and leaked, and each iteration works a batch: a
//! single lookup is a few nanoseconds, below this repository's documented
//! wall-clock noise on cloud hardware. See the same note in
//! `wacore/binary/benches/jid_benchmark.rs`.
