//! Client-level inbound non-message stanzas: `<receipt>`, `<presence>`,
//! `<notification>` and `<ack>`, from the decoded stanza to the dispatched
//! event.
//!
//! `client_receive` covers the `<message>` path, where a Signal decrypt
//! dominates everything around it. These four are the rest of the read loop —
//! no crypto, so what they measure *is* the machinery: classification, the
//! handler's boxed future, the parse, and the event bus. On an offline drain
//! they are also the bulk of the queue.
//!
//! **The metric to read here is bytes and allocations per stanza, not wall
//! time.** Every row's body is a few hundred nanoseconds of branch-heavy work
//! against a fixture that shares a runtime with an ack worker, so timings move
//! more between runs than any change worth making moves them; the allocation
//! columns (`divan::AllocProfiler` is wired in below) are exact. The regression
//! this target exists to catch is a per-stanza heap block growing back — an
//! `.await` on an unboxed handler arm re-inflates the notification future the
//! way it was before PR "perf(handlers)".
//!
//! Every stanza runs twice: once with nothing subscribed to its event kind and
//! once with a subscriber. That is not redundancy — the subscriber is what
//! decides how much of the pipeline runs. `has_handler_for` gates the receipt
//! parse, steers `processes_inline`, and is what makes an `Arc<Event>` exist at
//! all.
//!
//! What it does not cover, stated once so no number here is over-read:
//!
//! - **The read loop's task spawn.** Stanzas enter at `process_node`, which is
//!   what the spawned task calls; the spawn itself is not measured.
//! - **The socket write.** The transport `<ack>` a `<receipt>` or
//!   `<notification>` owes is marshalled and noise-encrypted by a worker; the
//!   sink transport drops the frame.
//! - **Stanza construction.** Each row builds its stanza once, before
//!   sampling, and re-submits it. Nothing on these paths dedupes, so a repeat
//!   is the same work as a fresh one.
