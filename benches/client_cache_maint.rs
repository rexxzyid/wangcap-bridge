//! Client cache maintenance: the write and sweep terms around the read path.
//!
//! `jid_keyed_cache` pins the per-message `get` hit/miss/create; what it
//! cannot see is what keeps that cache (and every sibling `Cache<Jid, _>`)
//! bounded: plain `insert` throughput, insertion at capacity forcing FIFO
//! eviction, and the `run_pending_tasks` sweep the keepalive maintenance tick
//! runs (`fa36dc61e`). The sweep row is the regression for re-adding unbounded
//! growth: with no TTL configured it must stay near-free, with expired
//! entries it must scale with the expired set, not the resident one.
//!
//! Driven on a bare poll loop rather than a Tokio runtime, for the reason
//! `jid_keyed_cache`'s header gives: uncontended `async_lock` futures complete
//! on the first poll, and a runtime would bill its scheduling to the lookup.
//!
//! Every measured loop inserts the same prebuilt keys: a monotonic key counter
//! made each sample insert never-before-seen keys, and the peak-memory
//! instrument read that allocator-state drift as signal (a false regression on
//! an unchanged file). Bit-identical work per sample keeps both instruments
//! honest.
//!
//! What it does not cover: the `TypedCache` custom-store path
//! (`src/cache_store.rs:96` `to_string` per op), which needs a backend and
//! belongs in `store_shapes`/`store_contention`, and the offline receipt
//! grouping itself (`group_delivery_receipts` is crate-private; its burst
//! shape is covered by `inbound_stanza`'s `burst_*` rows and its alloc floor
//! by its unit test).
