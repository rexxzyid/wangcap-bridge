//! Client-level 1:1 send, swept across the recipient's device count.
//!
//! `wacore`'s `bench_dm_send` covers the stanza preparation with sessions
//! already in hand; this is everything the client does around it on a warm
//! repeat DM: the wire-namespace decision, the memoized device resolution,
//! the LID/PN mapping lookups on the way to each device's Signal address,
//! the session pre-check, the per-device lock keys, and the marshal and noise
//! encrypt before the sink.
//!
//! Two addressing shapes, because they are two per-device code paths (see
//! `DmAddressing`): a migrated account sending to a LID, where no device
//! needs a mapping lookup, and an unmigrated account sending to a PN with a
//! known LID, where every device's address is looked up at each resolution
//! point. A repeat DM to the same recipient is the common case, so the sweep
//! is over the recipient's device count (1 = a phone, 5 = the maximum with
//! four companions) at a fixed one companion of our own.
//!
//! Not covered, so no number here is over-read: the SQLite backend (the
//! fixture stores in memory), first contact (the fixture is warm), and the
//! socket write (the transport drops the frame).
