//! Client-level group device resolution, swept across the number of groups
//! an account is active in.
//!
//! `client_group_send` sweeps one group across its size and holds the memo
//! warm by construction, so it cannot see what an account in many groups
//! gets from the per-group device memo. This target builds a client holding
//! `GROUP_COUNTS` groups of `SCALE_GROUP_MEMBERS` members each and asks the
//! two questions that decide whether a warm group send re-resolves its
//! members:
//!
//! - `warm_resolve_pass`: one pass over every group through the memoized
//!   resolver, the shape of a bot answering in each of its groups in turn.
//!   With the memo bounded at 64 entries and evicting oldest-first this was
//!   a cliff: every group past the 64th missed on every pass, and a miss at
//!   64 members re-resolves every member.
//! - `resolve_after_unrelated_refresh`: one group's device-list refresh
//!   through the real registry write path, then a pass over every *other*
//!   group. Whether those are re-stamped or recomputed is decided by the
//!   topology log, which used to overflow on any refresh past ~85 members.
//!
//! Not covered, so no number here is over-read: no Signal sessions and no
//! sends (the resolver is what is measured, not the encrypt), the
//! `InMemoryBackend` (a registry miss into SQLite is a separate cost, and a
//! larger one), and a single member device per member.
